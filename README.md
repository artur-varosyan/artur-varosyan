## Hi, nice to meet you! 👋

### About Me
I am a third-year computer science student at the University of Bristol 🇬🇧🎓, currently undertaking an academic exchange at the Singapore University of Technology and Design 🇸🇬. Please get in touch with me for collaboration on any projects!

### Projects
Here are some of the projects I have been working on:
* [Budgeting Bot Bubsy](https://github.com/artur-varosyan/budgeting-bot-bubsy) 💬 - A personal finance budget-managing tool written in Python. Deployed as a chatbot on the messaging platform Telegram. Bubsy records your expenses, shows your spending and keeps track of your budget.
* [Crossword Generator](https://github.com/artur-varosyan/crossword-generator) 📚 - A Python application generating a random and unique crossword each time it is executed using an online dictionary API.
* [GreenMap](https://github.com/mitchLui/greenmap) 📍 - An environmentally friendly navigation platform aggregating data from a range of sustainable transport providers, displaying the carbon emissions of each potential journey, enabling users to make a more informed decision. An honourable mention hackathon submission.
* [AR-Reshare](https://github.com/spe-uob/2021-ARReshare/)📱 - An augmented-reality enabled Android application allowing people to share the goods and gifts they no longer need or want. A joint collaborative project developed by a group of students from the University of Bristol and Durham University.
