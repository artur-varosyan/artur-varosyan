## Hi, nice to meet you! 👋

### About Me
I am a final-year computer science master's student at the University of Bristol 🇬🇧🎓. Previously, I spent a year studying at the Singapore University of Technology and Design 🇸🇬, and I interned as a Software Development Engineer Intern at Amazon. 🧑🏻‍💻

Please get in touch with me for collaboration on any projects!
