## Hi, nice to meet you! 👋

### About Me
I am a second-year computer science student at the University of Bristol 🎓. I am currently looking for Software Engineering Internships for Summer 2023. Please get in touch with me for collaboration on any projects!

### Projects
Here are some of the projects I have been working on:
* [Crossword Generator](https://github.com/artur-varosyan/crossword-generator) 📚 - A Python application generating a random and unique crossword each time it is executed using an online dictionary API.
* [GreenMap](https://github.com/mitchLui/greenmap) 📍 - An environmentally friendly navigation platform aggregating data from a range of sustainable transport providers, displaying the carbon emissions of each potential journey, enabling users to make a more informed decision. An honourable mention hackathon submission.
* [AR-Reshare](https://github.com/spe-uob/2021-ARReshare/tree/develop)📱 - An augmented-reality enabled Android application allowing people to share the goods, gifts and food they no longer need or want. A joint collaborative project developed by a group of students from the University of Bristol and Durham University.
